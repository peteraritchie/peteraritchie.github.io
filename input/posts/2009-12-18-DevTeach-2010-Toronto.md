# DevTeach 2010 Toronto

DevTeach 2010 Toronto has been announced with a great [session line-up][1]. This DevTeach turns out to be a fantastic deal because you not only get your usual DevTeah goodness (to attend the sessions, hob-nob with the speakers, etc.) but you also get a[ free copy of Visual Studio Professional ][2]with a 1 year MSDN Premium license. That's a US$2499 value alone; for the price of admission.

If you [register][3] before Jan 1 2010, admission is US$664 (30% off!); before Jan 30 2010, it's US$759; after Feb 1 2010, it's US$854; and after Mar 1 2010, it's regular price (US$949). So, the sooner you register the better the deal is.

If you're from out of town, if you book your accommodation before Feb 8 2010 you can save CA$50 off the daily rate of $189 at Delta Meadowvale.

I highly recommend DevTeach, the speakers are top notch.

This year I've finally found time in my schedule to give two sessions. I'll be doing "Being an Agile Consultant" and "Advanced Refactoring with Visual Studio 2010".

I hope to see you there.
