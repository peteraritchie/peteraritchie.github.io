# DevTeach Comes to Ottawa!

DevTeach is coming to Ottawa November 2-4 2011.



DevTeach has had some of the best speakers in the industry and some of the best sessions/tracks that I've ever attended.



This year is no exception, the [speaker line-up][1] is full of experts and MVPs like David Starr, Mitch Garvis, James Kovacs, Laurent Duveau, Mario Cardinal, Guy Barrette, Paul Neilson, Rob Windsor, Benjamin Day, Erik Renaud, Joel Semeniuk, etc. and locals like Garth Jones, Wes MacDonald, Joel Hebert, Colin Smith, Colin Melia, Brad Bird, Rick Claus, etc.



[Tracks][2] include Agile, Web Dev, Rich Client, SQL Server Dev, SQL Server BI, and for the first time at DevTeach, an IT Pro track.
