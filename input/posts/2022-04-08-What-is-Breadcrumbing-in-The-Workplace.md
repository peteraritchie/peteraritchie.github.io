The term "breadcrumbing" comes from the _dating scene_, where it is described
as "... the act of sending out flirtatious but non-committal social signals
(i.e., _breadcrumbs_)."  A.K.A. to _lead someone on_. It is a form of emotional
abuse that attempts to make someone dependent without committing to anything.

In the workplace, it's _stringing someone along with empty promises_, like
promises of advancement, benefits, new projects, roles, etc. All the while never
following through with them.

A handful of examples of "breadcrumbing":

- Your manager makes vague promises contingent on meeting goals but provides no
  way to judge progress or success.

- Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement
  will open new opportunities.

- Your manager "promotes" you to a new position with a new job description, but
  the opportunity to actually perform those duties never presents itself.

- Your manager or organization rewards burnout or poor work/life balance
  behavior.

- Your manager complements your performance on activities that aren't part of
  your job.

  - For example, only compliments about "hard work" or compliment you on your
    ability to perform _administrative_ tasks. Complements of activities that
    are not measurable to your job description result in an imbalance of power.
    It is at your manager's discretion how those acts would positively impact a
    performance review.

- Your manager only informally mentions performance, advancement, etc.

- Your manager hints at tasks that will look good on your CV.

- Your manager points out a need for improvement but provides no evidence or
  means to measure current or future progress.

- A project is touted as a huge success, but everyone on the front line "needs
  improvement."

The emotional outcome is the same whether the "breadcrumbing" is intentional or
not.

It is still "breadcrumbing" if a lazy or ineffective leader fails to provide the
measures and means for you to succeed and advance at your job.

Leaders are responsible for setting their team members up to succeed. Great
leaders understand that impediments are barriers to success and recognize that
they set their projects up for failure by not finding and removing impediments.

Returning to some "breadcrumbing" examples:

> Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement
> will open new opportunities.

Subjective measures are not quantifiable, making success just as subjective.
Someone can easily flip subjective success to objective failure. It possibly may
be measured as a success, but you have no means to hold your manager
accountable--only _they_ hold power. They are not setting you up for success.

> Your manager "promotes" you to a new position with a new job description, but
> the opportunity to actually perform those duties never presents itself.

This new position may be part of creating a new team with a specific vision and
mission, but the vision and the mission are ignored once started. (The lack of
setup for success) In worst cases, actually trying to follow the vision and
mission results in poor performance reviews. (The resulting failure). They've
hidden the fact that they have subjective expectations of success and have not
communicated them to you. They may even continue to reference the
misleading vision and mission. They can spring the hidden expectations at any
time to make you feel and look like you've failed.

From a psychological standpoint, "breadcrumbing" is a type of "intermittent
reinforcement." Intermittent reinforcement _itself_ isn't bad; it is an
effective way to develop positive behavior. It becomes "breadcrumbing" and
emotional abuse when the benefits are 100% one-sided.

What do you do if you think you're being "breadcrumbed"? One tactic is to ask why
they're delivering on those promises. Work with them to set a timetable with
measurable milestones to meet the promises. Another tactic is to ask what
you're not doing correctly and how to improve. Work with them to get clarity on
measures and track your accomplishments based on those measures. If the
breadcrumbing is unintentional, you'll probably see improvements quickly.

Another term for this is a "no-win situation." A no-win situation is a form of
workplace bullying and workplace harassment. It's unethical but usually not
illegal. Unless obviously race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation,
pregnancy, national origin, or age is involved.

An obvious no-win situation may be unlawful if it creates a work environment that
would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people. (I mentioned
"subjective above? Good, I did).

What worth your employer places on you and your peers is reflected in behaviors
like breadcrumbing. What worth you place on your employer is entirely up to you.

<!--
My opinion is to move on once you recognize this. It has been challenging to
move on in the past, but it is less of a challenge with the employment landscape
being what it is recently. This behavior shows how your employer views your
worth; it's up to you how much worth to give to your employer. I don't recommend
providing them more worth than they offer you.
