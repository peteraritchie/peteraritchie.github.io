The term "breadcrumbing" comes from the _dating scene_ where it's is described
as "... the act of sending out flirtatious but non-committal social signals
(i.e., _breadcrumbs_)". A.K.A. _leading someone on_. It is a form of emotional
abuse that attempts to make someone dependent without committing to anything.

In the workplace, it's _stringing someone along with empty promises._ Like
promises of advancement, benefits, new projects, roles, etc. All the while never
following through with them.

A handful of examples of breadcrumbing:

- Your manager makes vague promises contingent on meeting goals but provides no
  way to judge progress or success.

- Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement
  will open new opportunities.

- Your manager "promotes" you to a new position, with a new job description, but
  the opportunity actually to perform those duties never presents itself.

- Your manager or organization rewards burnout or poor work/live balance  
  behavior.

- Your manager complements your performance on activities that aren't part of
  your job.

  - For example, only compliments about "hard work" or compliment you on your
    ability to perform _administrative_ tasks. Complements about activities that
    are not measurable towards your job description result in an imbalance of
    power since it is at his discretion how those acts would positively impact a
    performance review.

- Your manager only informally mentions performance, advancement, etc.

- Your manager hints at tasks that will look good on your CV.

- Your manager points out a need for improvement but provides no evidence nor
  means to measure current or future progress.

- A project is touted as a huge success, but everyone on the front-line "needs
  improvement."

The emotional outcome is the same whether the breadcrumbing is intentional or
not.

It is still breadcrumbing if a lazy or ineffective leaders fails to provide the
measures and means for you to succeed and advance at your job.

Good leaders set their team members up to succeed. A great leader acknowledges
impediments and ensures they are visible.

Impediments are barriers to success; good leaders recognize this and understand
that not removing them is not setting their team members up for success (i.e. in
reality: **setting team members up for failure**.)

Returning to some breadcrumbing examples:

> Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement

Subjective measures are not quantifiable making success only subjective.
Subjective success can easily be flipped to objective failure. It may come to
fruition, but you have no means to hold your manager to account--only they hold
the power. They are not setting you up for success.

> Your manager "promotes" you to a new position, with a new job description, but
> the opportunity actually to perform those duties never presents itself.

This may actually involve the creation of a new team with a specific vision and
mission, but once started the vision and the mission are ignored. (The lack of
setup for success) In worst cases, actually trying to follow the vision and
mission results in poor performance reviews. (The resulting failure). They've
hidden the fact that they have subjective expectations of success ahd have not
communicated them in any way to you. They may even continue to reference the
misleading vision and mission. They can spring the hidden expectations at any
time to make you feel and look like you've failed.

From a psychological standpoint, breadcrumbing is a type of "intermittent reinforcement."
Intermittent reinforcement itself isn't bad; it is an effective way to develop positive
behavior. It becomes breadcrumbing and emotional abuse when the benefits are
100% one-sided.

What do you do if you think you're being breadcrumbed? One tactic is to ask why
they're delivering on their promises. Work with them to set a timetable with
measurable milestone for the promises to be met. Another tactic is to ask what
you're not doing correctly and how to improve. Work with them to get clarity on
measures and track your accomplishments based on those measures. If the
breadcrumbing is unintentional, you'll probably see improvements quickly.

Another term for this is a "no-win situation". A no-win situation is a form of
workplace bullying and workplace harassment. It's unethical but usually not
illegal. Unless race, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, pregnancy,
national origin, or age is obviously involved.

Obvious no-win situation may be unlawful if it creates a work environment that
would be intimidating, hostile, or offensive to reasonable people. (I mentioned
"subjective" above? Good, I did).

My opinion is to move on once you recognize this. In the past, it has been
challenging to simply move on, but this is less of a challenge with the employment landscape
being what is is recently. This behavior shows how your employer views your worth;
it's up to you how much worth to give to your employer. I don't recommend
providing them more worth than they offer you.
