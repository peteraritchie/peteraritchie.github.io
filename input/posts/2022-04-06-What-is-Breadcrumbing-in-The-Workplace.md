The term "breadcrumbing" comes from the _dating scene_ where it's is described
as "... the act of sending out flirtatious but non-committal social signals
(i.e., _breadcrumbs_)". A.K.A. _leading someone on_. It is a form of emotional
abuse that attempts to make someone dependent without committing to anything.

In the workplace, it's _stringing someone along with empty promises._ Like
promises of advancement, benefits, new projects, roles, etc. All the while never
following through with them.

A handful of examples of breadcrumbing:

- Your manager makes vague promises contingent on meeting goals but provides no
  way to judge progress or success.

- Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement
  will open new opportunities.

- Your manager "promotes" you to a new position, with a new job description, but
  the opportunity actually to perform those duties never presents itself.

- Your manager repeatedly mentions retirement, alluding to a potential position
  that would need a replacement but never retires.

- Your manager or organization rewards burnout or poor work/live balance  
  behavior.

- Your manager complements your performance on activities that aren't part of
  your job.

  - For example, only compliments about "hard work" or compliment you on your
    ability to perform _administrative_ tasks. Complements about activities that
    are not measurable towards your job description, resulting in an imbalance
    of power since it is at his discretion for those acts to impact a
    performance review positively.

- Your manager only informally mentions performance, advancement, etc.

- Your manager hints at tasks that will look good on your CV.

- Your manager points out a need for improvement but provides no evidence nor
  means to measure current or future progress.

- A project is touted as a huge success, but everyone on the front-line "needs
  improvement."
  - How is something so successful if everyone is doing a poor job?! Someone
    above you is taking the credit for the success and leaving you in the dust.

Under no uncertain terms _breadcrumbing_ is emotional abuse and is "lazy"
leadership (or lack thereof). Rather than providing the measures and means for
you to succeed and advance at your job, they resort to this type of emotional
abuse.

From a psychological standpoint, this is a type "intermittent reinforcement."
Intermittent reinforcement isn't bad. It is an effective way to develop positive
behavior. It becomes breadcrumbing, and emotional abuse, when the benefits are
100% one-sided.

My opinion is to move on once you recognize this. In the past, that has been
challenging, but this is less of a challenge with the employment landscape
recently. Remember, your employer has repeatedly shown how they view your worth;
it's up to you how much worth to give to your employer. I don't recommend
providing them more worth than they offer you. If you're getting no worth, it's
likely time to move on to a place that will.
