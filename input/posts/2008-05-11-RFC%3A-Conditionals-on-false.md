# RFC: Conditionals on false

Just a small request for comments. [Oren prefers][1]

  

 if (GetTrueOrFalse() == false)

â€¦instead of 

  

 if (!GetTrueOrFalse())

Coming from 18+ years of C/C++ based language programming, I find either equally readable; but, I'm not always the one reading my code.

What are you thoughts? Do you prefer the negation operator (!) or explicitly comparing with the false keyword?
