# DevTeach 2009 Vancouver

The schedule for DevTeach 2009 Vancouver has been announced (<http://www.devteach.com/>). There's lots of great software development sessions from some of the leaders in our industry.

If you're planning on improving yourself, this is the conference to go to. Not only can you attend excellent sessions; but you can hob-knob with the presenters and pick their brains.

If you have a friend or co-worker who's interested, there's a limited-time two-for-one offer for an even better price: <http://www.devteach.com/Register.aspx>
