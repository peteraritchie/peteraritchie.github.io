# Using Toolbox for Code Snippets in Visual Studio 2005

Just noticed today that you can drag text into the Toolbox then repeatedly drag it back out wherever you want, into aVisual Studio source window.

Simply select some text in a source window, drag it over to the Toolbox tab (assuming you have Toolbox set to Auto Hide), wait for Toolbox to expand and drop the text wherever you want it.

Now you can simply open up the Toolbox and drag-drop that text whenever you want, much like a code snippet; but much faster (and without literals).
