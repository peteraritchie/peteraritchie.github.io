# Changing TextBox Text as an Undo-able Action

The `TextBox` class supports undoing the last action–inherited from `TextBoxBase`. Normally the user does this by pressing the undo key (Ctrl-Z if your keyboard doesn't have a specific Undo key) or by selecting "Undo" from the context menu. The last action can also be undone programmatically by calling `TextBoxBase.Undo()` (after calling `CanUndo()` to see if `Undo()` will work).

Changing the text in a `TextBox` so that the change can be undone is not so obvious though. Changing the `Text` property or the `SelectedText` property is not undo-able. .NET 2.0 added `TextBox.Paste(String)` (not inherited from `TextBoxBase`, it's inherent to `TextBox`) that replaces the currently selected text and is undoable. If you want to replace all the text while allowing the user to undo it, simply call `TextBoxBase.SelectAll()` before `Paste(Sting)`. For example:

  

textBox.SelectAll();

textBox.Paste(text);

This side-effect, unfortunately, is not documented–which is why it "is not so obvious".
