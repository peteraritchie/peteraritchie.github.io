# Introducing EffectiveIoC

Last week I [tweeted][1] a few times about writing an IoC container in less than 60 lines of code. I also [blogged][2] about how I thought the average IoC container was overly complex and didn't promote DI-friendliness.

Well, EffectiveIoC is the result of that short spike. The core ended up being about 60 lines of code (supported type mappings—including open and closed generics—and app.config mappings). I felt a minimum viable IoC container needed a little more than that, so I've also included programmatic configuration and support for instances (effectively singletons). I've also thrown in the ability to map an action to a type to do whatever you want when the type is resolved. Without all the friendly API, it works out to be about 80-90 lines of code.

## Why?

Well, the project page sums this up nicely. For the most part, I wanted something that promoted DI-friendly design—which, from my point of view, is constructor injection. So, EffectiveIoC is very simple. It supports mapping one type to another (the _from_ type must be assignable to the _to_ type) and registering of instances by name (key). Registering type mappings can be done in app.config:

or in code:

And type instances can be resolved like this:

Instances can also be registered. In config this can be done like this:

Or in code, like this:

Instances can be resolved by name as follows:
