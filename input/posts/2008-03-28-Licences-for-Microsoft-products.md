# Licences for Microsoft products

Occasionally I get development questions that are governed by one or more product licenses (End-User License Agreement, "EULA"). One question that I see is "I've used Reflector to decompile the .NET Framework and want to use that C# code in my application".

You've installed some Microsoft software and agreed to the EULA but didn't save it and it's nowhere on your hard-disk. If you're not sure what your license terms are, there's a Microsoft web page that allows you to look up EULAs for many products: <http://www.microsoft.com/about/legal/useterms/>

By the way, the answer to the question is "You're not licensed to do that". Anyone know what clause in which EULA denies that?
