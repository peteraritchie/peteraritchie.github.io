# .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1

I noticed mention of .NET Framework 2.0 Service Pack 1 on a Microsoft site today.

The BCL Team's latest blog entry <http://blogs.msdn.com/bclteam/archive/2007/05/21/the-regexoptions-compiled-flag-and-slow-performance-on-64-bit-net-framework-2-0-josh-free.aspx> mentions a fix that will make it into the .NET Framework 2.0 SP 1. Seems an inevitable release of SP1 for .NET Framework 2.0 is pretty official.
