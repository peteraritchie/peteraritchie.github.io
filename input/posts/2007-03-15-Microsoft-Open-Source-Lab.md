# Microsoft Open Source Lab

After the the [Microsoft MVP Global Summit][1], I got a chance to meet with [Sara Ford][2] where she gave me a wonderful tour of campus. Part of that tour was an introduction to some of the folks at [port25.com][3] and a look at the open source lab. The port 25 folks are busy building an impressive set of servers (blades,HPC, etc) running various OSes (like many distributions of Linux and Unix, Windows Server, Compute Cluster Server, etc.) performing various tasks like interoperability tests and [codeplex.com][4] tasks. 

I can't do the complexity of their installation justiceâ€“a more detailed description can be found at <http://port25.technet.com/archive/2006/03/31/A-Look-Inside-Microsoft_2700_s-Open-Source-Software-Lab-_2800_Part-1_2900_.aspx>
