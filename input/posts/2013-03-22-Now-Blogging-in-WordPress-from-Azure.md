# Now Blogging in WordPress from Azure

### Post navigation

[← Previous][1] [Next →][2]

I've been meaning to switch my blog away from the msmvps.com site for quite some time. I delayed because I thought I wanted to host by blog on my web server—which meant fixing my web server (which I never seem to have the time for). But, I've decided I'd simply use a free web site on Azure to deploy WordPress.

If you haven't tried this before, it's *really* simple. If you have an Azure account, go on to the [Portal][3], click [Web Sites][4], then click the big +NEW at the bottom left. From there you can click on the "FROM GALLERY" option and choose WordPress. Other than creating a login for your WordPress blog, you've just created a WordPress web site.
