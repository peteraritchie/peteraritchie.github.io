# Visual Studio Revert-to-saved macros

I often run into situations where I'd like to undo all the work I've done in a file. Some applications refer to this as Revert-to-saved. Visual Studio 2005 does not seem to have a function to do this. So, I've written a couple macros to do this.

The first, RevertToSaved simply calls Undo until it can't undo anymore. This is much faster than holding the Ctrl-Z key down, and keeps your undo buffer.

  

 Sub RevertToSaved()

  While DTE.ActiveDocument.Undo() = True



  End While

 End Sub

The second, RevertToSaved2, is a little more brute forceâ€“it simply closes the current project item and reopens it, attempting to return to the same cursor location.

  

 Sub RevertToSaved2()

  Dim projectItem As EnvDTE.ProjectItem = DTE.ActiveDocument.ProjectItem

  If Not projectItem Is Nothing Then

   Dim activeLine As Integer = DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.ActivePoint.Line

   Dim lineCharOffset As Integer = DTE.ActiveDocument.Selection.ActivePoint.LineCharOffset

   DTE.ActiveDocument.Close(vsSaveChanges.vsSaveChangesNo)

   Dim window As EnvDTE.Window = projectItem.Open()

   If Not window Is Nothing Then

    window.Activate()

    window.Document.Selection.MoveToLineAndOffset(activeLine, lineCharOffset)

   End If

  End If

 End Sub

Enjoy!
