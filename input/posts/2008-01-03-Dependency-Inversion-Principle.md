# Dependency Inversion Principle

Martin Fowler coined[1] the term "Dependency Injection" in 2004 [1]. Dependancy Injection is a form of Inversion of Control. Inversion of Control, as far as I understand it is a pattern "discovered" by Fowler, although to a certain extent discussed in the Gang of Four's Design Patterns (but not defined strictly as a design pattern). Inversion of Control can be views as what Dependancy Injection utilizes. I.e. Dependancy Injection is a form of Inversion of Control (but not vice versa) but definition of Inversion of Control is a bit scetchy so that's a subjective view.
