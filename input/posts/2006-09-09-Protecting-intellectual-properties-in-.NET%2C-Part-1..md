# Protecting intellectual properties in .NET, Part 1.

One thing that bothers many people and organizations about .NET is the ease of which IL code can be re-hydrated into source code (C#/VB/etc.). While this has always been a problem with binaries, IL code is a much smaller set of instructions compared to the instruction sets of today's processors and is designed around accommodating high-level-language usage patterns–making it easier to translate into high-level source code. Native binaries could always be disassembled and the assembler codebe reassembled into another, new, application. But, it was assembler code, and optimized–nearly impossible to translate into a high-level-language,let alone similar to the original code. Everyone seems fine with this because it doesn't really look like the original code. .NET IL an be re-hydrated into source that is almost identical to the original–sans comments.

One thing you can do with .NET is to force a method to be precompiled to native code. This can be done by attributing the method with a little-known, not welldocumentedattribute: System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodImpl and setting the MethodCodeType property to System.Runtime.CompilerServices.MethodCodeType.Native.

Some caveats

* Seems to only work in a FullTrust environment.
* Since native methods can't be reflected these methods cannot be uses as event handlers
* May cause some grief for many debuggers.
* The Runtime severely restricts where methods tagged as Native can be loaded.
