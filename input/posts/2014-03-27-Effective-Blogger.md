# Effective Blogger

### Post navigation

[← Previous][1] [Next →][2]

I've been lamenting the lack of updates and support to Live Writer along with a few other people for quite some time. I've had in the back of my head that I'd write one some day.

The number of features I would need to support in terms of formatting seemed daunting. Until recently. I wrote a short Markdown app a while ago and the other day I thought "hey why not a markdown blog writer!"

I present [Effective Blogger][3] (in the Store). it currently supports WordPress blogs and the standar markdown. In fact this blog post was written with it!

Examples of formatting:

Heading  
=======

Sub-heading

* * *

Paragraphs are separated  
by a blank line.

Text attributes _italic_,  
**bold**, `monospace`.

A [link][4].
