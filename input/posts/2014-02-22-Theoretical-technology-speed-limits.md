# Theoretical technology speed limits

### Post navigation

[← Previous][1] [Next →][2]

Every now and then I think about upgrading or replacing technology I have. Often, this means looking at a completely different technology or a completely different standard. From a speed aspect, I often wonder "how does this compare to what I already have or how does this compare to other technologies.

For example, I was thinking it was about time to upgrade my network a bit (faster WiFi, faster twisted pair, etc) and was wondering about WiFi-enabled hard drive. But, I didn't know how that compared with my existing form of backups (USB 3) and whether the speed would outweigh the WiFi convenience.

I can never find a chart or graph that contains different types of technologies, so I created my own to better gauge the impact (at least in terms of speed) of a technology change:
