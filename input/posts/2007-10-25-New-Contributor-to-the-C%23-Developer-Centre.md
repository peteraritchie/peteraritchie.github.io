# New Contributor to the C# Developer Centre

A new contributor to the C# Developer Centre has posted a new article. This article goes into great detail about extension methods, what they are and how they're implemented. If you're more than curious about this feature of the soon-to-be-release Visual Studio 2008 and C# 3.0, it's a great read.
