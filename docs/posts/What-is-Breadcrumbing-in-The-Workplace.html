<p>The term &quot;breadcrumbing&quot; comes from the <em>dating scene</em> where it's is described
as &quot;... the act of sending out flirtatious but non-committal social signals
(i.e., <em>breadcrumbs</em>)&quot;. A.K.A. <em>leading someone on</em>. It is a form of emotional
abuse that attempts to make someone dependent without committing to anything.</p>
<p>In the workplace, it's <em>stringing someone along with empty promises.</em> Like
promises of advancement, benefits, new projects, roles, etc. All the while never
following through with them.</p>
<p>A handful of examples of breadcrumbing:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Your manager makes vague promises contingent on meeting goals but provides no
way to judge progress or success.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager suggests that certain subjectively measurable skills improvement
will open new opportunities.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager &quot;promotes&quot; you to a new position, with a new job description, but
the opportunity actually to perform those duties never presents itself.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager repeatedly mentions retirement, alluding to a potential position
that would need a replacement but never retires.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager or organization rewards burnout or poor work/live balance<br />
behavior.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager complements your performance on activities that aren't part of
your job.</p>
<ul>
<li>For example, only compliments about &quot;hard work&quot; or compliment you on your
ability to perform <em>administrative</em> tasks. Complements about activities that
are not measurable towards your job description, resulting in an imbalance
of power since it is at his discretion for those acts to impact a
performance review positively.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager only informally mentions performance, advancement, etc.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager hints at tasks that will look good on your CV.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Your manager points out a need for improvement but provides no evidence nor
means to measure current or future progress.</p>
</li>
<li><p>A project is touted as a huge success, but everyone on the front-line &quot;needs
improvement.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li>How is something so successful if everyone is doing a poor job?! Someone
above you is taking the credit for the success and leaving you in the dust.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Under no uncertain terms <em>breadcrumbing</em> is emotional abuse and is &quot;lazy&quot;
leadership (or lack thereof). Rather than providing the measures and means for
you to succeed and advance at your job, they resort to this type of emotional
abuse.</p>
<p>From a psychological standpoint, this is a type &quot;intermittent reinforcement.&quot;
Intermittent reinforcement isn't bad. It is an effective way to develop positive
behavior. It becomes breadcrumbing, and emotional abuse, when the benefits are
100% one-sided.</p>
<p>My opinion is to move on once you recognize this. In the past, that has been
challenging, but this is less of a challenge with the employment landscape
recently. Remember, your employer has repeatedly shown how they view your worth;
it's up to you how much worth to give to your employer. I don't recommend
providing them more worth than they offer you. If you're getting no worth, it's
likely time to move on to a place that will.</p>
