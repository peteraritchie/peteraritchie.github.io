<h1 id="the-subtle-differences-between-events-and-commands-in-a-message-oriented-system">The Subtle Differences Between Events and Commands in a Message-oriented System</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.eaipatterns.com/img/MessageChannelSolution.gif" class="img-fluid" alt="" />There's a common misconception I see in message-oriented software and discussions of such. That is with the role of commands versus events.</p>
<p>There are two basic message channel types: one-to-many and one-to-one. These are encapsulated in a couple of messaging patterns: publish-subscribe channel and point-to-point channel, respectively.</p>
<p>In any messaging system, what applications do are to &quot;send&quot; and &quot;receive&quot; messages. Semantics come into play when you start to focus the intent of your system and your messages. Semantically, you only &quot;send&quot; to point-to-point channels and &quot;publish&quot; to publish-subscribe channels. Sometimes you semantically &quot;publish&quot; to a &quot;topic&quot; in a channel; but you still &quot;publish&quot;</p>
<p>Messages, commands, and events are much like vegetables and fruits. A fruit is a type of vegetable but not all vegetables are fruits: commands and events are messages, but not all messages are commands and not all messages are events.</p>
<p>This relationship is mirrored by commands and events. You &quot;send&quot; messages and you &quot;publish&quot; events. This implies that commands only go over point-to-point channels, and events only go over publish-subscribe channels. The relationship of event to message means that you can send an event on a point-to-point channel, but never publish a command over a publish-subscribe channel.</p>
<p>Gregor Hohpe is reasonably clear on these patterns in Enterprise Integration Patterns when he says &quot;The Publisher-Subscriber pattern [POSA] expands upon Observer by adding the notion of an event channel for communicating event notifications&quot; Where [POSA] is &quot;Pattern-Oriented Software Architecture&quot; that also details an &quot;event channel&quot; when discussing publishers and subscribers.</p>
<p>In addition, Martin Fowler studies events and compares then briefly to commands and details &quot;…broadcasting events to everyone who may be interested but sending commands only [to] a specific receiver&quot; <a href="http://bit.ly/13DEN43">http://bit.ly/13DEN43</a></p>
<p>There are other references that detail these subtleties, e.g. <a href="http://bit.ly/1aejlBD">http://bit.ly/1aejlBD</a>.</p>
<p>Command messages are implementations of the Command Pattern–which is a means of encapsulating the parameters of a method/function. The command object is given directly to a single invoker object. The object that gives the command object to the invoker is decoupled from the actual method/function; but the command object is coupled to receiver object. i.e. in order to create a command object, the invoker and receiver objects must exist.</p>
<p>Publish-subscribe is an implementation of the Observer Pattern–which is a means of decoupling observers from publishers of notifications. To have an expectation of receipt and specific processing (i.e. a Command) is a level of coupling that Observer specifically avoids.</p>
<p>It's important to understand these subtleties because patterns are effectively a lexicon, each of which has specific meaning. When you use a lexicon of context or with the wrong meaning, you're defeating one of the main purposes of patterns and thus introduces confusion where you're trying specifically to avoid it.</p>
<p>To sum up, a command is sent to a particular receiver and a publisher simply publishes events. In pub/sub, who receives the events is handled by the channel, not by the publisher.</p>
