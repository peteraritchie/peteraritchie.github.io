# Message Oriented Design
In software there are a lot of methodologies, techniques, styles, and patterns.  Usually each one approaches re-usability from the perspective of one dimension of software development lifecycle.  Often the guidance remains focused within that dimension.  (Dimensions like contextual, conceptual [the business], logical, physical, etc.)  But, I have found in the last few years that much of this guidance applies to many if not all of the dimensions.  This is one such area.
