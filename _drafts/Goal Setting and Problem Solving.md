# Goal Setting and Problem Solving
For years I've had this nagging thought in the back of my mind that there must be a better way to describe analysis, problem solving, and estimating work than I continously see.  The problem with what I continously see is that it's very inaccurate, seems to lead to confusion, or just not thorough.  Ironicaly, what I'm about to detail is really based on thoroughness.

## Dining on Elephant
There's a tired, old metaphor on dealing with large or overhwelming tasks: "How do you eat an elephant? One bite at a time".  This is implying that to deal with large and overwhelming tasks that if you break it down into "bite-sized" chunks it will be more obvious how to start and how to track progress.

The principle is sound, but not very actionable outside of actually eating an elephant.  In the role of messenger, I'll package up and help explain some techniques that I've found that have helped me reconcile a better way.

## Goals
The fundamental part of 

## Compatamentalization

## Measures and Metrics
The fundamental reason for breaking things down and compatamentalizing things is for measurement.  You want to estimate, track progress, evaluate completeness, and prove success. 

## Means and Ends
