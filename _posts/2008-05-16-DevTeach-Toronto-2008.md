# DevTeach Toronto 2008

Well, DevTeach Toronto 2008 is just wrapping up.  It was a fantastic conference, many world-class developers, world-class presenters, and world-class topic.  Congrats to all.  It was well organized that the tracks that I took part in were well designed.

What's special about conferences like this is the ability to interact with peers and leaders from across our industry, something you can't get any other way.  If you went to the conference and didn't talk to anyone, you really missed out.

The next is [DevTeach][1] Montreal in December.  I highly recommend it.
