# Entity Framework Petition of Vote of Non Confidence

I had intended to be happy simply being a signatory of ADO .NET Entity Framework Vote of No Confidence.  But, there's people suggesting signatories of this petition are wackos or on the fringe.

Do yourself a favour and read [the petition][1].  Read what we have issues with and how we think Entity Framework (EF) can be improved to be a better product.  Read seminal material by industry leaders on entity-oriented and object-oriented application development like [Domain Driven Design][2], and [Agile Principles, Patterns and Practices in C#][3] (and the predecessor [Agile Software Development: Principles, Patterns and Practices][4]) and [Applying Domain-Driven Design and Patterns: With Examples in C# and .NET][5].  If after you have understand this information, you think being forced to use EF on a software development team would mean it would be hard to implement generally accepted object-oriented and entity-oriented design, the sign the petition.

Yes, you have the choice no to use EF; but you also have the choice to help people to not have to deal with the issues detailed in the petition simply because they were not made aware of them.

And despite the naysayers of people who think EF should improve, the ADO.NET team [is listening and agrees][6].
