# TechDays Canada 2009 Developer Foundations Call For Speakers

We need speakers for Vancouver and Toronto for the Developer Foundations track for TechDays Canada 2009.

We're finalizing the abstracts right now; but, it looks like there will be four sessions in this track.

SOLID : the five OO principles that will change your life forever.

* Will cover Single Responsibility, Open-Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.  What they are, how to use them, examples, etc. 

Refactoring for Fun and Profit

* How to improve your existing code and architecture through refactoring and avoid "another re-write". 

Advanced .NET (C# and VB)

* Advanced generics, lambdas and anonymous methods, LINQ to Objects, Error/Exception handling and throwing, etc. 

Layers, the secret language of architects

* Detailed domain layering.  Domain-Driven design will come into play with this session. 

Vancouver is September 14-15, and Toronto is September 29-30.

If you're interested you can email me (see the Contact link on the left, if you don't already have my email) or [Justice Gray][1] or send us a tweet ([@PeterRichie][2] and [@JusticeGray][3]) and we'll try to get more information to you as it is available.
