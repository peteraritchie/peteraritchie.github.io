# Software Design Priniples and Terminology

[Duck Typing][1] A means of matching a class interface, a method interface, or property interface based upon it's signature not by its inheritance.Â  e.g. Rather than requiring a type to implement an interface with a known method, duck typing to simply check the object for a method that matches and executes it.
