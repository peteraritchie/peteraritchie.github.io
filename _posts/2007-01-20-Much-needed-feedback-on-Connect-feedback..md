# Much needed feedback on Connect feedback.

S. Somasegar [recently blogged][1] that Visual Studio 2005 bugs logged via Connect that were fixed in SP1 are now listed. (listed here: <http://connect.microsoft.com/VisualStudio/content/content.aspx?ContentID=4324>).

Attributing Connect feedback to fixes is a huge step in the right direction.  It allows users to follow their feedback through fruition.  This is wonderful because–at least some–feedback won't fall into a black hole and give user's the impression that providing feedback via Connect is pointless.

 Let's face it, logging bugs can be a thankless and frustrating process.  The unlimited potential combinations of hardware and software installations sometimes makes reproducing bugs very difficult.  There's nothing more frustrating than seeing "can't reproduce" for a bug that you encounter daily.  This list provides the feedback to users that Connect is indeed a useful tool.
