# Unified Field Theory, is it Possible?

Is [Unified Field Theory][1] possible?  It sounds like it's more than elusive..

I was reading about some interesting theories that our reality may simply be a perception of several different realities.  Not entirely ground breaking; but, my take on it is that if our perception of these multiple realities is a side-effect of the interaction of these realities and that each reality may not follow the same rules as the other realities, can a "unified field theory" of **our** perception be possible?

This may have some interesting effects in that it may affect how Moore's Law can continue through discovery of new architectures.  In computer science, this will likely affect how software is written.
