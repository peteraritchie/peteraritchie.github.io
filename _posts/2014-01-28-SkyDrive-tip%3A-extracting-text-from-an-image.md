# SkyDrive tip: extracting text from an image

### Post navigation

[← Previous][1] [Next →][2]

I recently posted a tip about a useful feature of Windows Phone that hadn't gotten enough attention; but, there's and equally awesome feature in SkyDrive. (soon to be OneDrive).

In much the same way that you can use Windows Phone to extract text with Search/Vision, you can extract text in SkyDrive too.

You simply have to upload an image that has text in it to SkyDrive, then when you view it on skydrive.com, you can see any extracted text.  For example, if I took a picture of a page in a book:

![WP_20140128_12_47_10_Pro][3]

I could then upload it to SkyDrive and this is what I would see for "Extracted text":

![Untitled][4]

Notice the region I've highlighted with a yellow rectangle.
