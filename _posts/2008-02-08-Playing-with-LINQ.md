# Playing with LINQ

If you're interested in seeing what you can do with LINQ and want to learn the syntax, there's a wonderful new utility called [LINQPad][1] that is available.  It basically lets you type in LINQ statements (or create statements from tables) and see what the result would be with a given database.
